Testing neural mechanisms of event segmentation with fMRI

In this study, 47 healthy young adults viewed extended movie sequences of actors performing 4 different everyday activities while their brain activity was measured with fMRI. BIDS-compatible data are in ```sub-<participant_id>``` directories. BIDSifying scripts are in the code/ directory.

In a follow-up session, they completed recall and recognition memory tests and segmented the movies into events at coarse and fine grains. Memory and event segmentation data are in the ```derivatives/data/raw/behavioral/exp152_Session_2/``` directory. We also obtained event segmentation data from an online (MTurk) normative group (Bezdek et al., 2022), which are in the ```derivatives/data/raw/behavioral/mturk_segmentation_data/``` directory. The normative group's event segmentation data had higher quality and were used instead of the fMRI participants' event segmentation data.

Data processing and analysis scripts, processed data, data quality checks, statistical results, and figures are in the derivatives/ directory. Please see the ```derivatives/README.md``` file for more details.
